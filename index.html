                In order to properly quantify the performance of our various engine iterations, we needed to build 
                a dedicated engine testing stand capable of delivering the necessary fuel and oxidizer, and handling
                the thrust from the combustion reaction.

                As a part of the Whistler-Blackcomb subteam, the first project I was involved with was the integration of an HMI, PLC, various pneumatic actuators,
                and several temperature and pressure sensors with this engine test stand. 
                We used a Productivity Suite P-2000 PLC to control all logic and operations associated
                with the engine firing process. This involved using ladder logic to input all necessary sensor 
                readings, execute all operational procedures, and log all measurements of interest for future observation.
                On the HMI side, we used Indusoft web studio to create a functional, yet organized HMI capable of displaying
                all sensor readings and executing test stand operations.

                Since, we are dealing with high pressure gases, and a combustion reaction that produces large amounts of

                All implemented ladder logic includes safeguards to ensure that the operation is running within
                the modelled thresholds, and emergency stop capabilites should anything go wrong.

              <h4 class="text-left">The Context</h4>
              <p class=" text-left mb-3 mt-2">
                When our rocket eventually launches (hopefully in December, 2020), the onboard avionics system must be in constant communcation
                with all on-board sensors to relay flight status and execute mission-critical operations. This capability is vital to successfully
                reach an altitude of 100 km and return the rocket safely back to earth through the deployment of the recovery system. 
              </p>

              <p class="text-left mt-3"> 
                The rocket avionics system must be able to perform all necessary safety checks in the process of fueling, ignition, and eventually flight.
                Through its flight, the system must constantly monitor its GPS location, acceleration, and altitude. Our GPS and accelerometer units will
                eventually act as the primary data collection hardware. Location and acceleration values are taken straight from the readings we recieve 
                from these devices. 
              </p>
              <h6 class="text-left mb-2">State Machine Design</h6>
              <p class="text-left mt-3"> 
                I was responsible for building a robust, object-oriented state machine capable of keeping track of our rocket's status before and after launch.
                I implemented this solution in C++, where each state represents a critical phase of the launch and recovery sequence. Our prelimiary state diagram,
                including state transition criteria and state actions are shown in the diagram below.
              </p>

              <h6 class="text-left mb-3 mt-4">Altitude Detection</h6>
              <p class="text-left mt-3"> 
                For low-flying rockets that stay well within the bounds of Earth's atmosphere, a differential pressure sensor can be directly used to calculate
                our altitude via the application of the Barometric formula. However, with a rocket that is being sent to space, the atmosphere is so thin at higher
                altitudes, that this method of calculating altitude is far too unreliable.
              </p>

              <p class="text-left mt-3"> 
                Correctly measuring the altitude of our rocket in-flight is vital to the deployment of our recovery system after we have reached our target apogee.
                Since we cannot directly measure pressure, we must use the kinematics of the flight path, augmented with a Kalman filter to accurately predict
                and measure where we are in our flight path. We are still in the process of verifying our algorithm's functionality, and testing its implementation 
                throughly. Below are the results we have obtained thus far, using data gathered from our last 30,000 ft rocket "Sky Pilot" which launched this past
                year at the IREC Competition in New Mexico.

                    The 2019 Robot Competition featured an Avengers theme - robots had to navigate the course head to head against another robot, while trying
                    to collect both infinity stones and avengers and return them safely to their side of the playing surface. The following UBC article further

                    used the OnShape CAD platform to design all parts, and the assembly as a whole. We then used various methods to prototype and eventually build our chasse including
                    the use of hand tools, laser cutter, and waterjet cutter. Below, you can see our first prototype, our final CAD model, and ultimately the robot we built!

                  With this design, all electrical components were easily seen and accessed, and the downtime due to any major electrical changes was minimized.
                  The crossbar also assisted in reinforcing the linear slide structure which guided the claw carriage.

                <p class="text-left">
                  Our main strategy relied on picking up the infinity stones from their platforms. This required our claw to be able to hold onto the 
                  collected stones until we have reached our home area, then release the stones into their respective holes. We used a small servo motor
                  connected to two meshing gears with 5 inch arms to complete this task.

                  To raise and lower our claw carriage to match the appropriate height of the infinity stones, we used a winch or spool mechanism. To raise
                  the claw we would simply spin the winch motor which would wrap the string about the spool, providing a tension force parallel to the 
                  supporting rails.

                  using input data collected from our QRD Light sensor array. The following video shows one of our practice runs, where we were able to successfully

              <p class="text-left">
                The operation of our robot relied solely on the camera input feed it received from the virtual world. Within the gazebo simulation, a camera 
                mounted on the top of the robot facing forwards continuously fed our system with an image feed. The following image shows an example of the 
                frame we would recive back.

              <h6 class="text-left align-self-center">Our Architecture</h6>
              <p class="text-left">
                Since the only input to our system was the camera feed, our system needed to be capable 
                of transforming an input image into output commands through a series of callbacks and algorthims. At a very high level, this architecture 
                is summarized in the following diagram.
              </p>
              <img class = "img-fluid" src="img/Design Architecture.png" alt="">
              <p class="text-left">
                Each "callback" is essentially an asychronously running method responsible for handling a specific aspect of our robots operation. For example, 
                our "Car Callback" handles capturing images of the parked cars, as well as avoiding the roaming truck which circles the middle track. Our "Navigation 
                Callback" uses the camera feed to stay centered within the road, and to properly stop at crosswalks.
                After we have successfully navigated the course, our system has captured multiple images of each parked car we have passed.
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
                After capturing images of all parked cars, an "Objective Completed" flag withing our system gets set True. This starts the execution of our License Plate
                Image Processing Callback. 
              </p>
              <h6 class="text-left">License Plate Image Processing</h6>
              <p class="text-left">
                The captured images are first filtered and cropped to identify the portion of the image which has the parking location and plate number 
                information. Below, the images show an example of the unfiltered captured images, followed by the process of locating the areas of the image
                which hold the information we are looking for. It is worth noting that some of the images we capture are not completely in focus. Regardles, our
                algorithm was able to correctly identify and crop the images for further processing. After filtering the images, we send them through our pre-trained 
                neural network which outputs the parking location and licence plate number to the terminal and scoreboard with an accuracy of 98%.

                Within the gazebo simulation world, we had to deal with the constraint that output commands were discrete in nature, meaning there was only a finite 
                set of commands that we could give. In our case, this meant that we could not publish "go forward" and "turn left" commands at the same
                time. The result is that our robot looks very jittery as it travels. Its worth noting that this is simply a limitation of the platform
                the simulation was running in.

                  Participating in a fantasy baseball league is an annual tradition amongst my friends. However, year after year I began to notice
                  that I was picking specific players either because I recognized their name and liked them, or some "fantasy expert" said they would
                  have a great year. In either case, I was not making a well-informed or justified selection. There had to be a way to reduce the countless
                  numbers and expert recommendations into one meaningful number.

              <p class="text-left">
                To make well informed decisions, I needed to reduce all of the projected statistics into one single number. But the tricky part was comparing 
                metrics that are so fundamentally different. How would one compare stolen bases to strikeouts? Walks to home runs? Lets look at an example 
                with two different hypothetical players, with their Home Run and Batting Average projections for the following year.

                If we consider a hypothetical league that only considers Home Runs to score points, it would be very easy to determine the better choice.
                Player A is likely to get more Home Runs than Player B - therefore I would choose Player A. However, if we were to introduce a league where both Home
                Runs and Batting Average were included, it becomes much less clear who the better choice is. This is where the concept of a Z-Score comes in.

              <p class="text-left">
                A Z-Score is a common statistical variable which measures the number of standard deviations a number is away from the mean of a data set. This allows players to be compared, in each category, to the other players in the league. By measuring the number of standard 
                deviations a number is from the mean of all players in the league, we can directly compare Home Runs to Batting Average and, by extension, Player 
                A to Player B. The following is the Z-Score formula.

                Once we are able to directly compare a player's performance to all other players, category by category, we can then sum each players individual
                Z-Scores from each category, to get one "overall" Z-Score. This is exactly how I am able to convert multiple numbers across many different categories,
                into one, meaningful number.

                There are countless websites which offer free player projections, organized by category. For my projections, I used Python's BeautifulSoup library
                to scrape fangraphs.com for its "Steamer" fantasy baseball projections. Once I gathered all the data for each player, I saved the content into a Microsoft SQL
                server for easy table manipulation later on. The following images show the Steamer projections, as well as the saved table within Microsoft SQL. 
                Saving all of the information here made the data very easily accessible from the Visual C# program I used to calculated performance estimates.

                Now that I have gathered all of the statistics I need, the only remaining problem was ensuring that my main program worked for a variety of
                fantasy league formats. Some fantasy leagues are points-based, some are rotisserie-based, each includes different required positions to fill, and many 
                determine winners based on custom-selected categories. The program needed to include some functionality for the user to define the specifications of their 
                league, and the calculated Z-Score would be specific to their setup.

                To make sure that my program was robust enough to handle a variety of possible fantasy baseball leagues, all parameters involved in the Z-Score 
                calculation are based on the league parameters that the user enters. The User Interface of this league selection screen is shown in the image. Users can name 
                their league, set their roster composition, and determine which metrics are used to calculate points, including the relative weight of each metric involved.
                This is done for both hitters and pitchers.
